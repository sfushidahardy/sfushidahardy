  	<h2>About me</h2>
  	<p>I am a 4th year mathematics graduate student at Stanford University. I'm being advised by <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~cm5/">Ciprian Manolescu</a>. In May 2018 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and physics from the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html">University of Auckland</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MapsWithoutNZ/">New Zealand</a>. A year later, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in mathematics at the same institution.</p>
  	<p>I think of the world as being built up of all sorts of shapes, primarily consisting of gloopy blobs. It's not clear what these "gloopy blobs" are, so we need a way to study them. This is where mathematics comes in, as it is simultaneously a language and toolkit for investigating intangible things. In mathematics these objects are formalised as <i>manifolds</i>, and encompass more familiar objects like knots, surfaces, and polyhedra. I'm open to all flavours of mathematics that further our understanding of manifolds, from algebra to PDE.</p>
    <p>In addition to mathematics, I enjoy baking various breads, drawing meaningless art, and playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" title="Go (strategy board game)">go</a>. Recently I've been doing a lot of sculpture as well.</p>
    <p>Feel free to get in touch for any mathematical or non-mathematical advice if you feel like my advice might help!</p>

	<h3>Grad school application advice</h3>
	<p>As an international student, the graduate school application process was very confusing! I've compiled a short document <a href="advice.pdf" target="_self">here</a> which contains some advice based on my experiences. Hopefully you find it useful! I suggest looking for advice from other sources as well. The aforementioned advice together with many of my raw application materials can be found in <a href="all_the_advice.zip">this zip file</a>.</p>
	<table><tr><td><img src="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM/warner.jpg" width=90 height=140 alt=""></td><td><p>If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be Frank Warner's <b><i>Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups</i></b>.</p><p> I give a clear, detailed, and careful development of the basic facts on manifold theory and Lie Groups. I include differentiable manifolds, tensors and differentiable forms. Lie groups and homogenous spaces, integration on manifolds, and in addition provide a proof of the de Rham theorem via sheaf cohomology theory, and develop the local theory of elliptic operators culminating in a proof of the Hodge theorem.  Those interested in any of the diverse areas of mathematics requiring the notion of a differentiable manifold will find me extremely useful.  </p> <p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be?  <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>
